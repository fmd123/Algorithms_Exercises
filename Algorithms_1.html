<!-- Given a string, for example, “Hello World”, write some code to reverse that string (“dlroW olleH”).

(Hint: try using the Array.reverse() method! But, if you do, try solving it just using looping as well). -->

<!-- First I need to create the string.
in script do a split string thing split on "".
Then put it into an array
then do a reverse order thingy on it. 
Splitting on "" will keep the space between words intact.
Need a command to stop the loop e.g. when index = 0. 
Need a command to concatenate the array for output.

Use push to add each item to end of the backwards string.

Array.reverse method will just reverse it then console it etc. Looping would count down the index using minus minus.
-->



<!-- Put the script at the bottom -->
<script type="text/javascript">
// redo this with a prompt...

var rWsplit = "Soles occidere et redire possunt/ Nobiscum occidet semel brevis lux.".split("");
var backwards = [];
console.log (rWsplit);
var howMany = (rWsplit.length);
console.log (howMany);
var i =howMany - 1; 
console.log (i);
while (i >=0) {
	backwards.push (rWsplit[i]);
	console.log (backwards);

i = i - 1; //this is the afterthought and is at end of loop

}
backwards = backwards.join (""); //when done with loop need to put the string back together
console.log (backwards);

//I put in lots of console.logs because I wanted to see what was happening at every step. That's how I caught that I should assign howMany - 1 as first value of i. It was starting the array with undefined.
