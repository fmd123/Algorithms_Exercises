<!-- passingThru() was created to handle a scoping problem. the while loop conditions were leaking thru' 
I added the room variable to deal with a while-loop problem. (it quit after second iteration of unacceptable answer.)  
I put the while loop on top to deal with problem of app quitting if I finally did enter an acceptable answer.-->
