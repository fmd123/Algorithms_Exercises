<!-- Basic premise is that each round of while-loop tightens the range by truncating at the midpoiint. The old midpoint becomes either the new upper limit or the new lower limit.
The new midpoint is calculated and then the user is queried once more 
until user gives a yes response 
OR when (U - L = 0 ) 
or could use m = 0 (math.floor(.5) = 0) -->

<!-- I'm also doing  -->

<!-- What I was failing to realize at first was that I needed another variable to allow the range and midpoint values to cycle/juggle. I also needed to realize that the range needed to be "free-floating." -->

<!-- Do I need an absolute value for U-L?  -->
<!-- Don't forget Math.floor -->
<!-- For later: do .toUpperCase to handle either capitals or miniscule. 
				Make the response be a set of buttons? Good way to keep the functionality clear so user doesn't mistakenly enter wrong input.-->
